#LRU Project

This is an interactive web-based project that demonstrates the working of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache. Users can:
  Set cache capacity.
  Add (PUT) key-value pairs.
  Access (GET) stored values.
  Delete items from the cache.
Visualize MRU (Most Recently Used) and LRU (Least Recently Used) nodes in real-time with color-coded nodes.
